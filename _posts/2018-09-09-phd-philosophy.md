> Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been? 

Before I started my Ph.D at CMU, I had a full-time job in Yahoo Research. It's a decent job with decent salary in a decent location. Everything is just decent. But I am an agressive person and hate for being decent. So I decided to do a PhD at the end of my 20s. 

I had been keep thinking the reason that why I come to grad school, even when I am at the school. I also kept coming across with the junior undergradte/master students who are hesitating if they should do a PhD. Sadly, I don't even have a good answer for myself. I feel I just want to do a Ph.D. in my life. If I don't do it for now, it would be much harder for me to do it in my later life. It might be not finacially smart, but i hope it's intelligently smart. 

Being in Pittsburgh is a very special period in my life. Pittsburgh is a smaller and less crowded city, which means less opportunities. Very few friends will travel to Pittsburgh. I spend at least 90% of my time on my research, if it's not 100%. Usually, I leave home in the morning, and take the CMU escort shuttle at middle night. I spent significant time on  reading and reflecting. I read everything. Lots of paper of course, but more importantly, lots of books as well. Reflecting everything in my life. I know this might sound very nerdy. But that's the way I kill my time, which might not necessarily better than watching TV series. 

I do learn a lot, from my advisor as well as my peers. At CMU HCII, we welcome the new PhD students every year in the open house. Seeing these yound students always remind me the time when I come to the open house event. It's very much like the same. I remember the girl I picked up from the airport, pitched her new idea on the flight. I very much appreciate my advisor, for making me a person like me today. I am not really the ideal student. First, I know i am not a smart person. I learned that when I didn't excel in the Chinese Universal University Entrance Exam. Second, I am strong-minded. I am not always follow his advices and made lots of mistakes. In other words, I am a stubborn and ignorant student. 

The best thing in the graduate school might be the peers. At the middle night, when the campus is empty, there would be several single PhD students still hanging out in the lab space. Discussing the boring research ideas, judging other people's research, and most importantly, convincing the peers what a grand vision he has. 

Attending conference is of course important. I am a shy and socially awkward person. So I rarely approach to the professors I admired and introduced my self. To me, the most exciting thing is to meet my Ph.D. peers in other universities. In the last several days, we were discussing why we want to be faculties? what's the most important functionality of being faculties. Anhong, Chen, and me stayed in the hotel and discussed until 2am in the morning. 

I know it might sound very nerdy from many perspectives. A more well rounded person might be say "ok, all of them are equally important". Maybe I just don't want to be such a well-rounded person as a Ph.D. student.  




> The Ph.D. is the beginning, not the culmination, of your career. Get out sooner, rather than late. [So long, and thanks for the Ph.D.!](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/hitch4.html)

The point of Ph.D. is to get out of phd as soon as possible.

今日良宴会，欢乐难具陈。
弹筝奋逸响，新声妙入神。
令德唱高言，识曲听其真。
齐心同所愿，含意俱未申。
人生寄一世，奄忽若飙尘。
何不策高足，先据要路津。
无为守贫贱，轗轲长苦辛。
